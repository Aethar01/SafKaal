# Gilrain
## Backstory
    3122 years ago Gilrain was born a high elf to Maglor and Tinwire (pronounced tin-we-re), two elves on a council somewhere.
    Gilrain was a model child, following his parents guidance and reccomendations until 50 years of age.
    However it all changed when the Neogi attacked.;
    One of the largest wars in all of history were fought between the high elves of ____ and the Neogi,
    eventually forcing the high elves to make to the stars to make a counter offensive against the Neogi.
    Unfortunately Maglor and Tinwire we classed MIA, and Gilrain was captured.
    
    Gilrain was kept aboard a Neogi jammer, experimented on and tortured. In a last ditch effort Gilrain made an escape attempt.
    During the escape attempt Gilrain was badly injured but managed to jump from the rear cargo hold of a Deathspider into the Astral sea
    since the Deathspider was making a jump at the time.
    This left Gilrain stranded in the Astral Sea, floating. This remained the state of Gilrain for 3002 years.
    
    This year Gilrain was stumbled upon by a junker jammer surfing the astral with their net out. Gilrain was recovered and subsequently sold.
    His owners were not pleased to discover they had bought a combat trained veteran and to their dismay, Gilrain fought them and escaped,
    which brings us to the present.
