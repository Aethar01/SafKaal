# Anzenmezzeron
The city has many names: The Black City, The Zenith, The Eglin-Lillith, the End of Hope. Most know it by **Anzenmezzeron**, the City of One Billion Corpses. It was built before memory, and will persist long after the world of man has crumbled into dust and ashes.

Fools come, crossing waste and crag, time and sapce, to the end of the world to seek Anzenmezzeron for one reason:
    In this grand necropolis, <span style="color:red"> ***DEATH IS BROKEN.*** </span>

What dies in the black city never truly dies. It may be cut apart, scathed into a million pieves, thrown to the wind, burned, salted, and scattered - but it will still return in some form or another in six days, awakening with lungs full of tomb dust in some part of the city. This is because in the center of the city, deep in its labyrinthine bowels, is the **Ending of Death**. Nobody knows waht form it takes - whether it is the last angel, scorned by the Almighty, an icy black throne, and obsidian heart torn from a dying god, or a tumor of curses, buried deep within its dark and twisted corpulescence.
