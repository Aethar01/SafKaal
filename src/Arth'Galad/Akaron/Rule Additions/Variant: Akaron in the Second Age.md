# Variant: Akaron in the Second Age

Those looking to run a campaign with a greater focus on typical high fantasy elements may wish to run a campaign in the akaron setting prior to the dawn of the Third Age. During the Second Age, Akaron more closely resembled a standard D&D campaign setting, and existed in a period of stability that the events of the Third Age have since disrupted. Second Age Akaron uses the following lore and rule variants to the details stated in this book:

- The Great Weave does not yet exist

- Remove reference to Osman in the Shadow Weave Magic feat

- Adisa, Caliniel, Ewan, Gregor, The Lord of Artifice, and Osman are not deities

- Asmodeous is a living Titan-Borne deity

- Bahamut is a living Flower-Borne deity

- The Dawnborn are not yet created

- Tome of Morgul, Rememberence of Teleril, and Infernal Authority have not yet been crafted

- Naitúrion, the Plane of Study, has not yet formed

- Pelor’s Wrath does not occur
