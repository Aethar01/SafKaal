# The Rot

It is unkown where the Rot came from, but it was not part of Everlightâ€™s creation. Deep in the Adrekkii Badlands the Rot took root and has proved a challenge to those who call the badlands home.

A disease unlike others in Akaron, the Rot is resistant to magic and an almost certain death sentence, though there are those that believe a rare cure can be found in the far off continent of Lundar.

## The Monstery of the Ravenous Rot 

Located at the Ropes in Valtora, the monks of the monastery purposefully infect themselves with the Rot as the ultimate show of mind over body, most being driven mad.

The monastery welcomes those who wish to join their path, but few are crazy enough to follow in their self-destructive wake.

## Feat: One with the Ravenous Rot [General]

Learning from the monks of the Ropes allows for one to turn their curse into a blessing, sharpening their mind on the whetstone of Rot.

**Prerequisite:** Purity of Body class feature, infected with the Rot

**Benefit:** Your Purity of Body class feature now works against the Rot. Additionally, through your control over your immune system, whilst concious you can never accidentally infect another with the Rot, though you may still choose to be infectious.

You may add your wisdom modifier to the damage of your unarmed strikes.

From now on, you always have the fatigued condition, and you may gain additional monk levels regardless of your alignment.

## The Rot
DCs (60 injury, 30 contact, 30 inhalation)

Incubation period (4d6 days)

Once infected you can no longer lose the fatigued or exhausted conditions. Each day you are infected you have a 40% chance to gain 1 point of permanent con damage to a minimum of 4. After incubation, you must succeed a DC 13 Fortitude save each day or become fatigued, if you fail this save whilst exhausted you gain an additional -4 to strength and dexterity and can no longer move without support, after which if you gain fatigue again you die and a rot flower grows from your corpse.

The Rot is immune to magical healing and ignores magical and supernatural forms of immunity to disease.
