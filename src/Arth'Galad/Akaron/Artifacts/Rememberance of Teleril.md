# Rememberance of Teleril
A broach formed from the petals collected from Teleril’s resting place; it evokes the spirit of Teleril in its bearer, allowing them to achieve feats of legend.

---

Rememberance of Teleril has the following properties:
- Remembrance of Teleril provides its bearer a +12 enhancement bonus to dexterity, grants any of their weapon or natural attacks the Dread (Colossal+) property, and bestows them Teleril’s unique feat Finesse (Longsword).
- In addition, once per hundred years, Remembrance of Teleril allows its bearer to initiate the Epic Martial Manoeuvre, Dendar’s Ruin, emulating Teleril’s devastating strike against Dendar the Night Serpent.
- Dendar’s Ruin: Gaining the strength to topple unimaginable foes, when you initiate this strike, you make a weapon attack that deals damage as if it were the same size as your enemy, bypasses damage reduction, hardness, and immunity to precision-based damage, and shakes them to their core paralysing them for 1 round (ignoring immunity to the condition).
- Caster Level: 30th
