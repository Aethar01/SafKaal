# Echoportation
Of all the secret arts of Akaron, echoportation is perhaps the most ellusive. Few know of its exitence, and fewer still are able to harness its potential.

Echoportation is closely linked to psionics, though its true nature is still debated, is it simply a discipline of psionics or something else entirely. One thing is true though, all echoporters are proficient in mind magic.

## Manifest Echo [Psionic]
Echoporters master the art of unrealized timelines to summon the fading shades of reality to aid them.

**Prerequisite:** Manifester level 1st

**Benefit:** As a swift action you can manifest an echo in an unoccuppied within 15ft of you. This echo is a magical, translucent, gray image of you that lasts until it is destroyed, until you dismiss it as a free action, until you manifest another echo, or until you’re incapacitated.

Your echo has your AC, 1 hit point, and immunity to all conditions. If it has to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonus for the roll. It is the same size as you, and it occupies its space. On your turn, you can mentally command the echo to move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required). If your echo is ever more than 30 feet from you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed.

- As long as you are armed, your echo threatens as appropriate for the weapon you carry.

- When you make an attack on your turn, you may choose for it to originate from your space or the echo’s space.

- If an enemy would provoke an opportunity attack from your echo, you may make an opportunity attack against that creature as if you were in the echo’s space.

**Special:** A psychic warrior may select Manifest Echo as one of their psychic warrior bonus feats.

## Reverbarating Swap [Psionic]
Drawing on the ripples of your echoes, you can swim the tides of timelines, instantaneously appearing where you could have been.

**Prerequisite:** Manifest Echo, Manifester level 6th

**Benefit:** As a swift action, whilst psionically focused you can teleport, magically swapping places with your echo at a cost of 15 feet of your movement, regardless of the distance between the two of you.


## Echoportation as a Secret
Echoportation is an exceedingly rare study in the world of Akaron, to take echoportation feats during a campaign you will need to have been taught by another echoporter.

When designing a character with echoportation in mind, work with your DM to determine how your character has learnt the ways of Echoportation; more common methods could include, study with a follower of the God of Liminality, seeking the tutalage of a Phane, or comming across one of the few hidden masters of echoportation.
