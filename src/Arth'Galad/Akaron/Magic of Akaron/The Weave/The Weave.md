# The Weave
Spellcasters of Akaron must draw power from one of the few sources available, most draw from the Weave, generated by the sun and the moon, for it is all they know how to.

Arcane spellcasters draw directly, usings its power to fuel their spells, whilst divine spellcasters invoke a higher authority to draw on the Weave for them and grant their spells.

Spellcasters may only draw from one weave at a time, as a result a character cannot take more than 1 Weave feat.

### Sorcerers
Lucky few are born sorcerers, sorcerers are born attuned to a source of magic and their soul inately produces its magic, allowing them to forgo the need to draw from an external source. How one is naturally born a sorcerer remains a mystery to scholars.
