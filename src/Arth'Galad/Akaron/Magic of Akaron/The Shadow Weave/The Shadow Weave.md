# The Shadow Weave
Until recently the Shadow Weave was an esoteric and hidden source of magic, hidden within the dark moon, Mor-Ithil. Upon Mor-Ithil’s destruction, the Shadow Weave’s source became the moon’s accretion ring, the magic spread through Mor-Ithil’s remains, and visible to all.

## Shadow Weave Magic [Weave]
You have discovered the dangerous secret of the Shadow Weave.

**Prerequisite:** Wis 15, or Patron deity Osman

**Benefit:** From now on, your spells tap the Shadow Weave instead of the Weave. You can also activate magic items that use the Shadow Weave without taking damage.

The saving throw for every spell you cast from the schools of enchantment, illusion, and necromancy increases by +1. You also get a +1 bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance with spells from these schools.

The Shadow Weave proves less than optimal for effects involving energy or matter. Your effective caster level for spells you cast from the schools of evocation or transmutation (except spells with the darkness descriptor) is reduced by one. A 1st-level Shadow Weave user cannot cast spells from these schools at all.

You can no longer cast spells with the light descriptor. No matter what school they are from, such spells automatically fail. Your ability to use magic items that produce light effects is also limited—you cannot invoke an item’s light power if its activation method is spell completion or spell trigger.

From now on, any magic item you create is a Shadow Weave item.

### Shadow Weave Items
Spell-like effects generated from Shadow Weave items have the same benefits and limitations that Shadow Weave spellcasting has. Activating a Shadow Weave item deals 1d4 points of temporary Wisdom damage to the user. A use-activated Shadow Weave item instead deals 1 point of temporary Wisdom damage the first time it is used each day. If the item functions continuously, the temporary Wisdom damage occurs at dusk each day or when the user takes off or puts aside the item, whichever comes first.
