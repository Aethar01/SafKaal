# The Great Weave
Daer Ungwe in Elvish, the Great Weave was the creation of Osman, the God of Shadow Magic and Ambition. A goal born from his study of the Shadow Weave as a mortal, Osman longed to create a weave of his own free from the oversight of gods; despite becoming god of the Shadow Weave, this goal persisted. Whilst the Shadow Weave is an anti-Weave, formed from the negative space in the Weave, the Great Weave stands alone, a distinct and separate source of magic. Whilst designed to be used by arcane spellcasters, any spellcaster is able to learn how to tap into the Great Weave.

## Great Weave Magic [Weave]
The creation of the Great Weave was hoped by some to usher in a new golden age of arcane study. Identifiable by their orange eyes, those who use the Great Weave often find themselves advancing faster in their studies than their peers.

**Prerequisite:** Int 15, or Patron deity Osman.

**Benefit:** From now on, your spells tap the Great Weave instead of the Weave. You can also activate magic items that use the Great Weave as normal, and magic items you create are Great Weave items.

Your spellcasting classes provide you 0 spell slots of the spell level one higher than expected for your class level, allowing you to learn and cast spells of that level if your ability score modifier is high enough (classes with spells known provide at least 1 known spell in levels with 0 spell slots). Until you take the Improved Spell Capacity feat, this feat will not provide 0 spell slots in spell levels above 9th.

You can no longer cast spells with the energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) descriptors, such spells automatically fail. Your ability to use magic items that produce energy effects is also limited; you cannot invoke an itemâ€™s energy power if its activation method is spell completion or spell trigger.

### Great Weave Items
If a non-Great Weave user attempts to use a Great Weave item, they must succeed a Use Magic Device check as if they were not a spellcaster. Great Weave items cannot hold energy descriptor spells.

## Force Mastery [General]
The Great Weave has proven itself useful at producing force effects, through careful study one can find way to take advantage of this for a wider range of spells.

**Prerequisite:** Great Weave Magic, Spell Mastery, caster level 9th

**Benefit:** When casting any spell you selected for the Spell Mastery feat, you may choose to add the force descriptor to the spell for that casting, if you choose to do so, half of the damage dealt is force damage.
