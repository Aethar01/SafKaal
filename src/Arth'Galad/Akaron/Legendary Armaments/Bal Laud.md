# Bâl Laud

Bâl Laud is the magnum opus of Sindri, the legendary craftsman of Mjolnir, crafted in tandem with the so-called “Lord of Artifice”. It is a fine hammer of unmatched craftsmanship, highly prized as the only means for the craft of mortals to rival the gods.

- +6 Skillful Warning Spellblade (Greater Dispel Magic) Shattermantle Wand Chamber Initiative Greater Dispelling Adamantine Pearl Steel Light Hammer.
- Artifact Creation (Su): Use of Bâl Laud enables the creation of once impossible items, artifacts of old. This allows the creation of magic items that exceed the normal market price limits.

- Dreamhammer (Ex): If Bâl Laud is not wielded by someone for 5 years or at its current wielder request, Bâl Laud returns to its resting place on top of an anvil in the Dreamheart. While it rests there, it broadcasts dreams to suitably skilled crafters, beckoning them to claim it.
