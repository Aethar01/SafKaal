## Powers in Arth'Galad
After its discovery by Union in 4610u, Arth'Galad was found to posses unique properties, most noteably the presence of what Union scientists have termed the "Adaptive Energy Transference and Harmonic Emission Resonance" (AETHER) field. This field seems to emanate from Arth'Galads star, Akaron. Both Arth'Galad and Akaron named as such by the native peoples of Arth'Galad who seemed to have longer and pointier ears than the average human as well as possesing about double the lifespan. The meanings of the names are yet unknown.

The AETHER field seems to have a number of effects on the planets of Arth'Galad, the most notable of which is its ability to seemingly balance naturally unstable orbits and atmospheres. The AETHER field also seems to have a number of effects on the local flora and fauna, one result of which is the development of intelligence in a number of species that Union imported to the system.
Additionally, the AETHER field seems to somewhat block the omninet, making it difficult to communicate with the rest of the galaxy. This has lead to the development of a number of local networks that are only accessible on Arth'Galad.

After observing the native peoples and a number of experiments, union scientists have discovered that the AETHER field can in some way be harnessed by sentient beings. This has lead to the development of a number of technologies that are unique to Arth'Galad. These technologies collectively are known as "Magnetic Aetheric Gravitational Interaction and Convergence" (MAGIC) technology. The most notable of these technologies is the ability to manipulate the AETHER field to ones will to produce a number of effects. The most common of these effects is the ability to manipulate the elements as considered by Old Humanity before the Fall, however, more advanced users have been able to manipulate more abstract concepts.

It didn't take long before word of Union's discovery of Arth'Galad and the AETHER field spread to the other factions. The other factions have since sent their own expeditions to Arth'Galad to study the AETHER field and the MAGIC technology along with Arth'Galad's seemingly unproportional levels of resources.

### Union
The first non-native faction to discover Arth'Galad, Union has since established a number of research stations on the planet to study the AETHER field and MAGIC technology. Union has also established a number of agreements with the native peoples of Arth'Galad to gain access to the Enlil and it's moons. Their building and infrastructure development has been in line with the native peoples' building styles as well as being sustainable and environmentally reversable.

### IPS-N
The second faction to discover Arth'Galad in 4700u, IPS-N has since established a number of mining operations in the astroid belt of Arth'Galad along with Pele and Apolake. They provide large shipping across the system and to other systems through the Voltura gate.

### SSC
The third faction to reach Arth'Galad in 4810u, SSC has since forcefully gained control of Izanagi and a small point on the point of Izanami closest to the two planets lagrange point, particularly intrigued by the development of non-human sentient life on the planets. They maintain an iron grasp on the planets and their peoples, exploiting them for labour and experimentation while actively attempting to gain more land on Izanami.

### Harrison Armory
The fourth faction to reach Arth'Galad in 4850u, Harrison Armory's arrival was marked by a number of severe conflicts with both Union, SSC and IPS-N. Most notably the Battle of Ouranos where an all out nuclear war occured on the planet and its moon. Harrison Armory were defeated by combined Union and IPS-N forces and have since been forced to retreat to the more sparse areas of the system, setting up bases on Pele, Apolake and a central operating base on Ninlil. Since then Harrison Armoury have been supplying any actors they can with weapons and technology to try and destabilise the system to gain profits and a foothold.

### HORUS
The group known as HORUS to those on the deep depths of the omninet, seem to have a relatively strong presence in the system despite the omninet being dampned. They seem to have a number of agents in all factions and have been known to have been involved in a number of conflicts in the system. They seem to be particularly interested in the AETHER field and the MAGIC technology and actions taken HORUS cells seem to be on the rise as of late however, their true motives are unknown.
