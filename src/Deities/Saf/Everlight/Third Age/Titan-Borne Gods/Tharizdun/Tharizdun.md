# Tharizdun
### The Chained Oblivion, the Mad God

With every fiber of his being, Tharizdun craves nothing less than the unmaking of the universe, destroying everything—himself included—in the process. Accordingly, the other gods imprisoned him away beyond the bounds of the universe he wants to destroy. But Tharizdun’s cults still persist, seeking ways to communicate with their dark master and free him to wreak havoc once more.
