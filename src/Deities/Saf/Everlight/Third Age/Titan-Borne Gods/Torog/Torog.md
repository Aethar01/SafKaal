### God of Torture, the Crawling King

Torog, The King that Crawls, is the evil god of the Underdark and imprisonment, patron of jailers and torturers. Common superstition holds that if his name is spoken, the King that Crawls burrows up from below and drags the hapless speaker underground to an eternity of imprisonment and torture. Jailers and torturers pray to him in deep caves and cellars, and creatures of the Underdark revere him as well.
