# Gruumsh
### He-Who-Never-Sleeps, the Ruiner

Gruumsh , deity of orcs, is chaotic evil. He appears as a hulking orc in black full plate armor. He has one unblinking central eye. He harbors a special hatred for Corellon, Moradin, and their followers. In ages past, Corellon put out Gruumshâ€™s left eye in a fight. Some orc clerics dispute this tale, claiming that the elven deity stole the eye because they could not beat Gruumsh in a fair fight.
