# Bane
### The Strife Emperor, the Black Hand

Though above mortality, Bane’s primary goal is notably human — he seeks nothing short of the total domination of Akaron. When his servants sit upon the throne of every land, when commoners serve their masters in fear for their very lives, and when alturism and hope have been erased from the world, then Bane will rest.
