# Tiamat
### The Scaled Tyrant, Queen of the Evil Dragons

Tiamat , like her archrival, Bahamut, was revered as a deity in many locales. All evil dragons payed homage to Tiamat; green and blue dragons acknowledged her sovereignty the most readily. Good dragons had a healthy respect for Tiamat, though they usually avoided mentioning her or even thinking about her. In her natural form, Tiamat was a thick-bodied dragon with five heads and a wyvernâ€™s tail. Each head was a different color: white, black, green, blue, and red. Her massive body was striped in those colors. Tiamat had many consorts, include great wyrm dragons of the white, black, green, blue, and red types.
