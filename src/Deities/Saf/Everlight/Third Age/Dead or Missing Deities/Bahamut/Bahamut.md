# Bahamut
### The Platinum Dragon, Master of the North Wind

Bahamut was revered in many locales. Though all good dragons payed homage to Bahamut, gold, silver, and brass dragons held him in particularly high regard. Other dragons, even evil ones (except perhaps his archrival Tiamat), respected Bahamut for his wisdom and power. In his natural form, Bahamut was a long, sinuous dragon covered in silver-white scales that sparkled and gleamed even in the dimmest light. Bahamut’s catlike eyes were deep blue, as azure as a midsummer sky, some say. Others insist that Bahamut’s eyes were a frosty indigo, like the heart of a glacier. Perhaps the two accounts merely reflected the Platinum Dragon’s shifting moods.
