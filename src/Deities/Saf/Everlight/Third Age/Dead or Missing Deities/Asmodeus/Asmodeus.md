# Asmodeus
### The Lord of the Nine Hells, the Fallen

Once a powerful greater deity, Asmodeous governed the hells and the kingdom of Aternum with an iron grip. He usually took the form of a tall imposing cambion and wielded his infamous ruby rod. Asmodeous finally fell to a coalition of five adventurers and two gods bringing an end to centuries of his tyrannous rule.
