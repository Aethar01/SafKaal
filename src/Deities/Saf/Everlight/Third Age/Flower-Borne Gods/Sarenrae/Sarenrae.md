# Sarenrae
### The Everlight, the Dawnflower

Sarenrae is usually depicted as a very beautiful, strong woman with dark golden skin, golden-brown eyes, and long hair made of solar fire wreathing her head. She has two large ivory-feathered and pearled wings, sometimes flaming. As the god of compassion and redemption, the Everlight bears a message of determination and compassion, even in the darkest of times.
