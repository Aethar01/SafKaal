# Moradin
### The Soul Forger, The All-Hammer

The deity of dwarves, Moradin , usually appears as a stern-faced male dwarf with a powerful build. His upper body is particularly robust, with a barrel chest, wide shoulders, and arms corded with big muscles. He has flowing black hair and a beard to match, and he always wears full plate armor. He carries a shield and a warhammer. Moradin forged the first dwarves out of metal and gems and breathed life into them.
