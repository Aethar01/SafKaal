# Avandra
### Lady Luck, the Changebringer
Avandra is the goddess of freedom, trade, travel, adventure, and luck. She encourages her followers to venture into the unknown. Her nature leads to few temples dedicated to her in the centers of civilization, but they can be found near well traveled roads.
