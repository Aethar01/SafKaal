# Corellon
### The Arch Heart, The Protector

The deity of elves, Corellon, usually appears as an androgynous elf clad in a sky-blue cloak and armed with a longbow and longsword. They also wear a large, circular amulet that bears their crescent moon symbol. They have a lithe and swift look about them, and their movements are both swift and graceful.
