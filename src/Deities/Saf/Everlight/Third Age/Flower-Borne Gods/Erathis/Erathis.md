# Erathis
### Goddess of Civilization, the Lawbearer

Erathis is shown as a hooded, armored woman sitting atop a throne or a throne of pillars, her face obscured or expressionless. Since Bahamutâ€™s passing, she has been described as the most dutiful and self-sacrificing of the Flower-Borne. Judges and lawful rulers pay respect at her temples, which are central structures in major cities around the world.
