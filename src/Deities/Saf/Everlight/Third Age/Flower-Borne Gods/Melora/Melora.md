### The Wild Mother, Goddess of Wilderness and the Sea

The Wild Motherâ€™s realm extends to wherever the seas shift and the land grows over. As the keeper of the wilderness, she represents the wild creatures of nature, the rush of the angry rapids, and the heat-heavy stillness of the desert. Hunters, druids, and nomads worship her, seeking her blessing to live in harmony with lands that still bear their wild fangs.
