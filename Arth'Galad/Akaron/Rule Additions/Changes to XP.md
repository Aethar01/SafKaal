# Changes to XP

Many apsects of 3.5e rely on xp, as such milestone on its own can cause several parts of the game to break. As a result the following change was used:

Every character has a pool of xp dependant on their level (see Craft Points variant), which may be used as xp would usually be used, and as craft points. Craft feats that enable the creation of a new type of magic item raise the maximum amount of xp a character can have by 500 x the minimum level required to meet the prerequisites, when first taken they also grant an equal amount of xp.

If a character spends a week focussed on replenishing their xp, they regain 2d4% of their maxiumum xp.
