The Staff of Mor-Ithil is a staff of unknown origin, although it appears a twisting mass of petrified roots.

The Staff of Mor-Ithil has the following properties:
- Functions as a Staff of Power (CL 20) with the following changes: Maximum charges - 15, regains 1d4 charges every day at dusk, When the retributive strike action is taken, its effective charges is equal to 5 times the charges in the staff and in addition it reforms 2d10 days later assuming the two halves are within 5 miles of one another.
- In order to wield Mor-Ithil, the wielder must make a Spellcraft (Shadow) check at DC 40. Apon failure the user cannot try to wield the staff and suffers 10 temporary intelligence damage. Once the wielder makes the check once, from then on they no longer need to make this check.

- Summon Shadows (Su): Three times per day the staff may summon 2d4 shadows. Immune to turning, they serve the wielder as if called by a summon monster V spell cast at 20th level.
- Summon Nightshade (Su): Once per month, the staff can summon a nightcrawler nightshade that serves the wielder as if called by a summon monster IX spell cast at 20th level.
- Shadow Form (Su): Three times per day the wielder can become a living shadow, with all the movement powers granted by the gaseous form spell.
- Shadow Bolt (Su): Three times per day the staff can project a ray attack that deals 10d6 points of cold damage to a single target. The shadow bolt has a range of 100 feet.
- Shadow Lore: In order to wield the Staff of Mor-Ithil, the wielder must have the Shadow Weave Magic feat and succeed a DC 40 spellcraft check, failure results in 2d10 temporary intelligence damage.
